# Unemployment Analysis with Python

# Business Problem:
  The business problem is to analyze the unemployment rate, especially in the context of the sharp increase observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
This involves understanding the factors contributing to unemployment, identifying trends and patterns in unemployment data, and potentially developing 
strategies to address unemployment challenges.

# Business Insight:
  Analyzing the unemployment rate provides valuable insights into the economic health of a region or country. By understanding the underlying factors influencing
unemployment, policymakers, businesses, and individuals can make informed decisions regarding workforce development, economic policies, job-seeking strategies, 
and investment opportunities. Moreover, analyzing the impact of external events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on unemployment rates can help in preparing for 
future crises and mitigating their effects.
